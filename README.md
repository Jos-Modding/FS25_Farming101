# Farming 101

WORK IN PROGRESS

## How to contribute
Edit one of the files in the tutorials directory, changes will be reviewed.

### What is markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor
Using markdown's title and paragraph formatting, we can use scripts to convert this into XML, which can be read by the game.

How to structure your tutorial:

**Title**

`# How to make pig food`

**Paragraph**

`This is a paragraph`

**Image**
`![description](images/<filename>.png)`

## Planned articles
